# PrinOfSoft-FinalProject
A repository for the Final Project for Principles of Software &amp; Requirements for Engineering (SOFE 2720) course. The project is to design a Sudoku game on a computer interface using the Agile process

Technology used: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Stucture:
In the sudoku folder, the sudoku.html file contains the structure of the game and the game data which includes the javascript code that runs the application. Most of the code within this file pertains to the javascript code. 
In the sudoku folder, the sudoku.css file contains and controls the style of the of the game. This includes the color of the grid, backgound and font-size. 

Technical Choices: 
This program contains a 9x9 grid generated by two for loops under the function generateTable. This function sets the rows and columns of the game and then under the function generateBoard, the numbers of the game are set. Numbers that are preset change everytime the game is refreshed. There are also other functions that make up the rules of the sudoku game which involves not having a duplicate number within the same quadrant, no duplicate numbers within the same row and column, and if the rules are all satisfied, a pop up message is displayed stating "You win the game!". Finally, the game was chosen to be made using html, css and js over java and other languages as customization was very open in html, css and js. 

Improvment for Future Versions:
- Instead of a drop down box to select a number, hoverng over a quandrant will display the options in a circle. 
- When a user enters in a number wrong or doesn't fullfill one of the rules, the quadrant will become red
- If the user enters in a number correctly and fullfill's all rules, the quadrant will become blue
